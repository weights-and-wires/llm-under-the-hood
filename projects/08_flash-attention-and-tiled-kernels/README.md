# Project 8: Flash Attention and Tiled Kernels

> The actual idea behind FlashAttention is not a new algorithm. It's a different schedule for the same algorithm — one that never materializes the full (T, T) score matrix in memory. This project demonstrates the schedule on CPU with explicit memory accounting.

## Hook

You hear "FlashAttention is 2-3× faster" so often that it's easy to assume there's a clever new math trick inside. There isn't. The math is identical. The contribution is a tiled execution schedule that respects the GPU memory hierarchy and never holds the `(T, T)` attention score matrix in main memory. That is what makes the wins possible — both wallclock and peak-memory.

## The Concept

**Naive attention** computes `scores = Q @ K.T` (shape `(T, T)`), softmaxes it, multiplies by `V`. That intermediate `(T, T)` matrix is the memory bottleneck. At `T = 8192`, fp16, it's 128 MB per head per layer.

**Tiled attention** processes `Q` in chunks of `q_block` rows. For each chunk, it walks over `K` and `V` in chunks of `kv_block` columns, maintaining a running `max` and softmax denominator. At the end of each `Q` chunk, it normalizes and writes back. The full `(T, T)` matrix is never built.

The trick is the **online softmax**:

```
m_new = max(m, max(scores_block))
alpha = exp(m - m_new)            # rescale old accumulator
beta  = exp(scores_block - m_new) # this block's contributions
output_so_far = output_so_far * alpha + beta @ V_block
denom         = denom         * alpha + sum(beta)
```

When you finish all `K/V` chunks for a given `Q` chunk, divide accumulator by denominator. The result is exactly what softmax-then-matmul-by-V produces — same math, never materializing `(T, T)`.

## Why It Matters

Long-context LLMs (32k, 100k tokens) are not possible with naive attention because the `(T, T)` matrix would be tens of GB at scale. FlashAttention's tiled schedule is the reason it's even feasible to run attention over a book's worth of tokens.

## What Got Built

A CPU reference implementation of tiled causal attention, side-by-side against naive attention, with explicit peak intermediate-memory accounting.

### Files in this folder

| File | What it is |
|------|------------|
| [`build.py`](build.py) | `naive_attention` and `tiled_attention`; both causal, both return `(output, peak_intermediate_floats)` |
| `step_*.py` | The book's code blocks, extracted step-by-step. Reference material. |
| `tests/test_unit.py` | 10 tests: shape checks, naive peak memory is `2*T²`, tiled matches naive across multiple `(T, d_head, q_block, kv_block)` parametrizations including non-divisible cases, tiled peak < naive peak |

### How to run

```bash
python build.py --tiny      # T=128, d_head=32, instant
python build.py --full      # T=512
pytest projects/08_flash-attention-and-tiled-kernels/
```

## Outputs (from `python build.py --tiny`)

```
Sequence length T = 128, d_head = 32
Q,K,V each: (128, 32) = 4096 floats each

naive  :  output_shape=(128, 32)  peak_intermediate=32768 floats
tiled  :  output_shape=(128, 32)  peak_intermediate=2048 floats

max |naive - tiled|  = 3.58e-07
mean |naive - tiled| = 2.87e-08
(should be near zero — both compute the same attention)

Naive peak intermediate: 32768 floats  (= 128.0 KB at fp32)
Tiled peak intermediate: 2048 floats  (= 8.0 KB at fp32)
Memory reduction: 16.00x
```

Two things to take away:

1. **Outputs match within floating-point precision.** Max diff is 3.6e-7, mean 2.9e-8. These are the FP rounding errors you get from doing the same arithmetic in a different order. The schedule preserves correctness.

2. **Peak intermediate memory dropped 16×.** From 32k floats down to 2k. At small T this doesn't matter on CPU; the script doesn't run measurably faster. But the ratio scales with T.

### What it looks like at real LLM scale

| T | d_head | naive (peak fp16) | tiled (peak fp16) | reduction |
|---|--------|--------------------|---------------------|------------|
| 128 | 32 | 64 KB | 4 KB | 16× |
| 2048 | 64 | 16 MB | 256 KB | 64× |
| 8192 | 64 | 256 MB | 1 MB | 256× |
| 32768 | 128 | 4 GB | 8 MB | 512× |

That 4 GB → 8 MB at `T = 32k, d_head = 128` is the reason long-context fine-tuning is feasible at all on accessible hardware. The actual FlashAttention paper goes further — it tiles for the **GPU's** memory hierarchy specifically (SRAM/HBM), which is why it also wins on wallclock. But the peak-memory win is what this CPU reference makes visible.

## No separate BREAK IT

The bug everyone hits when writing tiled attention by hand is the **online softmax**: forgetting to rescale the accumulator when a later block produces a higher max. That bug doesn't crash — the output just silently disagrees with naive attention. The parametrized tests in `tests/test_unit.py` catch exactly this; if you mess up the rescale logic, `test_tiled_matches_naive` fails immediately. That test suite IS the break-detector.
