# Under the Hood

### Build Every Layer of a Large Language Model from Scratch

> *A practical manual for understanding how modern language models are built, where they fail, and how to reason about their behavior like an engineer instead of a spectator.*

**By Ramchand Kumaresan**

**Build it. Break it. Measure it.**

## What This Repo Is

This is the runnable code companion for the book *Under the Hood: Build Every Layer of a Large Language Model from Scratch*. Each of the book's **35 projects** has its own folder under `projects/`, with a runnable `build.py`, a `break_it.py` experiment, per-step reference files, and captured outputs.

You can do the entire book by reading the book and typing the code yourself — that's the recommended path. But when you get stuck, or want to compare your code to a reference, or want to skip ahead and read the working version before building it yourself, this repo is where you look.

The book itself (PDF + EPUB) is distributed separately via Leanpub. This repo intentionally does **not** ship the book — it ships the code.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mechramc/Under-the-hood.git
cd Under-the-hood

# Create an environment (any tool works; this is one option)
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate     # or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows

# Install
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run any project's main script
python projects/01_the-learning-machine/build.py --tiny
```

Full setup instructions: see [`setup/`](setup/).

## The Method: Build → Break → Measure

Each project follows the same disciplined rhythm:

1. **Hook** — the question the project answers.
2. **The Concept** — the idea in plain English, before any code.
3. **Why It Matters** — what fails in the real world without this piece.
4. **The Build** — step-by-step implementation, written so shapes stay honest.
5. **Break It** — a deliberate sabotage of the system, with predictions and observations.
6. **Optional Homework** — full lab, proxy lab (for limited hardware), result-guided version.
7. **Questions To Answer** — what you should be able to defend after finishing.
8. **Go Further** — research anchors and next directions.
9. **What You Now Know** — the explicit deltas in your mental model.

Reading the book without breaking the code is half the experience. The breaks are where the lessons actually live.

## Who This Is For

- **Engineers** who can ship software but feel like LLM internals are wizardry happening behind an API.
- **Researchers** who want a working mental model of the full stack before reading their hundredth attention paper.
- **Students** who learned PyTorch from notebooks and want to know what a training run *actually* does.
- **Practitioners** tuning, deploying, or fine-tuning models who keep hitting failure modes they cannot explain.

You should be comfortable with Python and have seen a tensor before. Everything else is built up from scratch.

---

## Hardware Notes

Every project supports a `--tiny` mode that runs on CPU in under 60 seconds. The full lab versions have realistic compute requirements:

| Project Range | Realistic Hardware for the Full Lab |
|---|---|
| Projects 1–7 | CPU or any laptop GPU |
| Projects 8–17 | One consumer GPU (8–24 GB) or short cloud rental |
| Projects 18–27 | One consumer GPU; LoRA paths designed for tight VRAM |
| Projects 28–35 | One GPU for full labs; proxy versions documented for all |

See [`setup/03_gpu-and-hardware-tiers.md`](setup/03_gpu-and-hardware-tiers.md) for the detailed breakdown.

## Philosophy

> *Build it. Break it. Measure it.*

This is not a tagline. It is the entire epistemology of the book.

- **Build it** because reading is not understanding. Understanding is being able to reproduce.
- **Break it** because a working system tells you what it does. A broken system tells you why it has to be that way.
- **Measure it** because intuition without numbers is the most expensive failure mode in machine learning.

Modern LLMs are not magic. They are a stack of carefully-tuned engineering decisions, each one earned by a specific failure that someone, somewhere, had to debug at 2am. This book makes you the person who debugged it.

## About the Author

**Ramchand Kumaresan** writes systems-level engineering manuals for AI practitioners. His work focuses on the parts of the stack that are usually skipped: the failure modes, the diagnostics, the parts of the codebase that exist as scar tissue from a real outage. *Under the Hood* is the first book in a series on building production-grade machine learning systems from first principles.
